| id        | The ID of the curve.<br />The return value is ID (int).                                                                                                                                                 |
| rowCount  | The number of row of the curve data table.<br />The return value is number of row (int).                                                                                                                |
| colCount  | The number of column of the curve data table.<br />The return value is number of column (int).                                                                                                          |
| typeID    | The type ID of response curve.<br />The return value is an int notation of [PostResultCurve](../../../psj-command/DItem-types).                                                                         |
| curveType | The type of response curve .<br />The return value is a string of response curve type (str).                                                                                                            |
| frequency | The column data of frequency. This attribute is only used for Frequency response.<br />The return value is a double vector of frequency.                                                                |
| amplitude | The column data of amplitude corresponds to the frequency column. This attribute can be used for both Frequency response and Transient response.<br />The return value is a double vector of amplitude. |
| phase     | The column data of phase corresponds to the frequency column. This attribute is only used for Frequency response.<br />The return value is a double vector of phase.                                    |
| real      | The column data of real corresponds to the frequency column. This attribute is only used for Frequency response.<br />The return value is a double vector of real.                                      |
