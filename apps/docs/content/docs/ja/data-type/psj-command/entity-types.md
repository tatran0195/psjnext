title: DItem Types
id: DItem-types
---

This is an enumeration type represents type of DItem in Jupiter.  
The ID of item which is primarily used in functions can be referred to in the Int Notation column.  
However, in order to explicitly describe meaning of ID, user can use `JPT.DItemType.DItem` instead of specifying ID.  
For example: `JPT.DItemType.BODY` is equal to ID = 3.
