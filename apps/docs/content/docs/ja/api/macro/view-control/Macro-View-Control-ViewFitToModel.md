## Description

Fit model to current screen.

## Syntax

```psj
View Fit To Model()
```

## Inputs

This function does not require any input value.

## Return Code

This utility function does not have output value.

## Note

When this command is used within PSJ code, the screen may be in a different state than expected due to the screen refresh function for animation. In that case, use DisableScreenAnimation() to stop the animation and display only the last frame.

## Sample Code

```psj {4}
# psj usage with disable screen animation
Geometry.Part.Cube()
JPT.DisableScreenAnimation()
JPT.Exec("View Fit To Model()")
JPT.Exec("ViewPoint(4)")
```
